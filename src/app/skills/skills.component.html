                    C# (C-sharp) is a general-purpose, multi-paradigm programming language. 
                    C# encompasses static typing, strong typing, lexically scoped, imperative, declarative, functional, generic, object-oriented (class-based), and component-oriented programming disciplines. 
                    C# was designed by Anders Hejlsberg from Microsoft in 2000 and was later approved as an international standard by Ecma (ECMA-334) in 2002 and ISO (ISO/IEC 23270) in 2003. 
                    Microsoft introduced C# along with .NET Framework and Visual Studio, both of which were closed-source. 
                    At the time, Microsoft had no open-source products. Four years later, in 2004, a free and open-source project called Mono began, providing a cross-platform compiler and runtime environment for the C# programming language. 
                    A decade later, Microsoft released Visual Studio Code (code editor), Roslyn (compiler), and the unified .NET platform (software framework), all of which support C# and are free, open-source, and cross-platform. 
                    Mono also joined Microsoft but was not merged into .NET. As of 2021, the most recent version of the language is C# 10.0, which was released in 2021 in .NET 6.0.

                    The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. 
                    It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript. 
                    Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. 
                    HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document. 
                    HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. 
                    HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. 
                    HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets.

                    Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML. 
                    CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript. 
                    CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts. 
                    This separation can improve content accessibility; provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics; 
                    enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content; 
                    and enable the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting. 
                    Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup page in different styles for different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice 
                    (via speech-based browser or screen reader), and on Braille-based tactile devices. 
                    CSS also has rules for alternate formatting if the content is accessed on a mobile device.

                    TypeScript is a programming language developed and maintained by Microsoft. 
                    It is a strict syntactical superset of JavaScript and adds optional static typing to the language. 
                    TypeScript is designed for the development of large applications and transcompiles to JavaScript. 
                    As TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, existing JavaScript programs are also valid TypeScript programs.
                    TypeScript may be used to develop JavaScript applications for both client-side and server-side execution (as with Node.js or Deno). 
                    There are multiple options available for transcompilation. 
                    Either the default TypeScript Checker can be used, or the Babel compiler can be invoked to convert TypeScript to JavaScript.
                    TypeScript supports definition files that can contain type information of existing JavaScript libraries, much like C++ header files can describe the structure of existing object files. 
                    This enables other programs to use the values defined in the files as if they were statically typed TypeScript entities. 
                    There are third-party header files for popular libraries such as jQuery, MongoDB, and D3.js. TypeScript headers for the Node.js basic modules are also available, allowing development of Node.js programs within TypeScript.

                    Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. 
                    It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let programmers write once, run anywhere (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need to recompile. 
                    Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer architecture. 
                    The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++, but has fewer low-level facilities than either of them. The Java runtime provides dynamic capabilities (such as reflection and runtime code modification) that are typically not available in traditional compiled languages. 
                    As of 2019, Java was one of the most popular programming languages in use according to GitHub, particularly for clientâ€“server web applications, with a reported 9 million developers.

                    JavaScript, often abbreviated JS, is a programming language that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. 
                    Over 97% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for web page behavior, often incorporating third-party libraries. 
                    All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices.
                    JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard. 
                    It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. 
                    It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).
                    The ECMAScript standard does not include any input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities. 
                    In practice, the web browser or other runtime system provides JavaScript APIs for I/O.
                    JavaScript engines were originally used only in web browsers, but are now core components of some servers and a variety of applications. 
                    The most popular runtime system for this usage is Node.js.

                    SQL, Structured Query Language) is a domain-specific language used in programming and designed for managing data held in a relational database management system (RDBMS), or for stream processing in a relational data stream management system (RDSMS). 
                    It is particularly useful in handling structured data, i.e. data incorporating relations among entities and variables. 
                    SQL offers two main advantages over older readâ€“write APIs such as ISAM or VSAM. Firstly, it introduced the concept of accessing many records with one single command. 
                    Secondly, it eliminates the need to specify how to reach a record, e.g. with or without an index.

                    The .NET Framework (pronounced as "dot net") is a proprietary software framework developed by Microsoft that runs primarily on Microsoft Windows. 
                    It was the predominant implementation of the Common Language Infrastructure (CLI) until being superseded by the cross-platform .NET project. 
                    It includes a large class library called Framework Class Library (FCL) and provides language interoperability (each language can use code written in other languages) across several programming languages. 
                    Programs written for .NET Framework execute in a software environment (in contrast to a hardware environment) named the Common Language Runtime (CLR). The CLR is an application virtual machine that provides services such as security, memory management, and exception handling. 
                    As such, computer code written using .NET Framework is called "managed code". FCL and CLR together constitute the .NET Framework.

                    ASP.NET MVC is a web application framework developed by Microsoft that implements the modelâ€“viewâ€“controller (MVC) pattern. 
                    It is no longer in active development. It is open-source software, apart from the ASP.NET Web Forms component, which is proprietary. 
                    ASP.NET Core has since been released, which unified ASP.NET, ASP.NET MVC, ASP.NET Web API, and ASP.NET Web Pages (a platform using only Razor pages). 
                    MVC 6 was abandoned due to Core and is not expected to be released. Core is currently planned to merge into ".NET 5".

                    Android Studio is the official integrated development environment (IDE) for Google's Android operating system, built on JetBrains' IntelliJ IDEA software and designed specifically for Android development. 
                    It is available for download on Windows, macOS and Linux based operating systems or as a subscription-based service in 2020. 
                    It is a replacement for the Eclipse Android Development Tools (E-ADT) as the primary IDE for native Android application development. 
                    Android Studio was announced on May 16, 2013, at the Google I/O conference. It was in early access preview stage starting from version 0.1 in May 2013, then entered beta stage starting from version 0.8 which was released in June 2014. 
                    The first stable build was released in December 2014, starting from version 1.0.
                    On May 7, 2019, Kotlin replaced Java as Google's preferred language for Android app development. Java is still supported, as is C++.

                    Microsoft Visual Studio is an integrated development environment (IDE) from Microsoft. 
                    It is used to develop computer programs, as well as websites, web apps, web services and mobile apps. 
                    Visual Studio uses Microsoft software development platforms such as Windows API, Windows Forms, Windows Presentation Foundation, Windows Store and Microsoft Silverlight. 
                    It can produce both native code and managed code.
                    Visual Studio includes a code editor supporting IntelliSense (the code completion component) as well as code refactoring. 
                    The integrated debugger works both as a source-level debugger and a machine-level debugger. 
                    Other built-in tools include a code profiler, designer for building GUI applications, web designer, class designer, and database schema designer. 
                    It accepts plug-ins that expand the functionality at almost every levelâ€”including adding support for source control systems 
                    (like Subversion and Git) and adding new toolsets like editors and visual designers for domain-specific languages or toolsets for other aspects of the software development lifecycle (like the Azure DevOps client: Team Explorer).

                    Microsoft Office, or simply Office, is a family of client software, server software, and services developed by Microsoft. 
                    It was first announced by Bill Gates on August 1, 1988, at COMDEX in Las Vegas. 
                    Initially a marketing term for an office suite (bundled set of productivity applications), the first version of Office contained Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel, and Microsoft PowerPoint. 
                    Over the years, Office applications have grown substantially closer with shared features such as a common spell checker, OLE data integration and Visual Basic for Applications scripting language. 
                    Microsoft also positions Office as a development platform for line-of-business software under the Office Business Applications brand. On July 10, 2012, Softpedia reported that Office was being used by over a billion people worldwide.
                    It contains a word processor (Word), a spreadsheet program (Excel) and a presentation program (PowerPoint), an e-mail client (Outlook), a database management system (Access), and a desktop publishing app (Publisher).
